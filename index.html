			<p> Welcome to my page. As you can see on the top my name is Steven Martinez. I'm 25 years old and this is the first portfolio web page that I have worked on by myself. I love video games and technology but that doesnt mean you wont see me playing basktball or any type of sport really including bowling and table tennis. I love the outdoors and I love animals. I own two cats myself actually, Link and Zelda. I also have my own car, a 1996 Mazda Miata which I named Midna. I'm not sure what else to write here, im not that good at writing these things. I hope you enjoy looking through my page and hopefully we can work together on a project. Goodbye everyone!!!  </p>
